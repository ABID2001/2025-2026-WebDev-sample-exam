What will the following code snippet do? Provided the product with id  10 is not there

var p = _context.Products.Find(10);
if (p == null)
{
p = new Product { Id = 10, Name = "Test" };
_context.Products.Update(p);
_context.SaveChanges();
}

Will likely result in an error or a failed database operation

Will add new Product in the database with product Id 10

Will update the database with product Id 10

Will cause a compile time error because of re-assigning p from null to a new Product
